🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – ML Model & Analysis

This project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning.
I analyzed the wine dataset, performed feature exploration, cleaned the data, and trained an ML model to classify wine quality.

🔍 What I Did in This Project

- Loaded and explored the wine dataset

- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values

- Performed EDA with visualizations

- Analyzed correlations between features

- Built ML models (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)

- Evaluated model accuracy and performance

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Insights

- Alcohol content strongly influences wine quality

- Volatile acidity has a negative impact

- Random Forest performed better than simple models

- Dataset is suitable for classification tasks
