🧹 NYC Airbnb Dataset – Data Cleaning & Preparation

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the NYC Airbnb dataset for further analysis or machine learning.
The goal was to take a raw dataset and convert it into a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready form.

🔍 What I Did in This Project

- Checked data integrity and structure

- Handled missing values (median/mode)

- Removed duplicate records

- Standardized text formats (names, neighbourhoods)

- Fixed incorrect data types

- Identified & treated outliers

- Validated cleaning using plots (boxplots, distributions, heatmaps)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Improvements After Cleaning

- Missing values handled safely

- Data became more consistent & readable

- Outliers removed or capped

- Dataset ready for EDA or ML

- Cleaner structure → better accuracy in future models
